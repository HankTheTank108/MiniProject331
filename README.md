# MiniProject331

This is the repository for my project. To use the code, download the file titled "Pokemon_Stats(Real)" from this repository, then run the first box of code in the google colab file, when prompted to upload a file upload the file you downloaded from here, then run the next box of code to edit the csv file, and then you're able to freely run any of the other boxes
